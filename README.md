## Lab 1:
I learn what is Software Testing. I practice with a C++ unit test example

### How to practice with C++ unit test example
### 1. Clone the repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BaoTran019/software_testing_sgu_2025_personal.git
cd software_testing_sgu_2025_personal/Lab1
```
### 2. Set up the environment
**install g++**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++
```
**Remember** to install Python Jupyter notebook
```bash 
pip install notebook
```
### 3. Modifying test case if you want
There are many test case input file name start with tc_<number>.inp.
You can create your own test case with new tc_<number>.inp or modify the existed with format
"value_A value_B value_c"
### 4. How to run
```bash
jupyter notebook testing.ipynb
```
### 5. What do we get after running the testing
Example outputs
```bash
"TC-1"
Expected: Infinite Solution
 The equation has 2 real solution(s): 2.55811e+062 -2.55811e+062 
"TC-2"
Expected: Infinite Solution
 Infinite solutions.
"TC-3"
Expected: No Solution
No solution.
...
```
To view results, let
```bash
cd ./output
```
